# GameFlow v1.1.1 for Unity 2017.2, 2017.3 and 2017.4

Please note this package is compatible ONLY with the Unity 2017.2.x, 2017.3.x and 2017.4.x versions. If you are using a newer version of Unity you could experience unexpected issues. 

In order to ensure that you have always the correct version of GameFlow in your project, please follow these steps:

1. Open the local storage folder for Unity Asset Store packages:

- Windows: C:\Users\{USER}\AppData\Roaming\Unity\Asset Store-5.x
- macOS: /Users/{USER}/Library/Unity/Asset Store-5.x

2. Remove the entire "Evasion Games" folder you will find there.
3. Open your project with the newer Unity version.
4. Open the Asset Store window or reload if it was already open.
5. Download GameFlow again from the Asset Store.
6. Import GameFlow in your project.
7. Check this [Version] file after the import.
